Written by Robert Nystrom

##Summary of the book
It contains both a AST tree walking interpreter built in java, and a bytecode interpreter in C.
It goes through all the hoops of implementing a VM and how to Parse a language, twice..

##Lox
The language it impelenet is called Lox, a simplified language with C-style syntax.
Among other things it has lambda functions and classes.

##Reference
Although I bought a paper copy of the book, I later found it is [online](https://timothya.com/pdfs/crafting-interpreters.pdf).
I think it is very good to have a real copy, so consider bying it.
